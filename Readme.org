I want to lint gitlab from emacs.
First step is to have a script to talk to gitlab so here.

* Usage

1. Clone this repo or procure =gitlab_lint.clj= source code.
2. =bb gitlab_lint.clj <file.yml>= or =./gitlab_lint.clj <file.yml>=
   
** Config

*** file
- Either have a file called =config.edn= in the working directory
- Or have a =GITLAB_LINT_CONFIG_FILE= env var

*** Example

#+begin_src clojure
   {
  ;; a list of list of program and args, that is passed to `shell/sh` and has as output your token
  ;; they are tried in order
  :token
  [["printenv" "GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN"]
   ;; ["pass" "gitlab-token"]
   ;; not recommended
   ;; ["echo" "token-token"]
   ]
  :gitlab-url "https://gitlab.com"}
#+end_src


** emacs command
When I desire a gitlab lint capability in my currently running emacs I eval =doc/gitlab-yml-lint.el= and do =M-x gitlab-yml-lint= in gitlab yml files, good enough.

* goals

- emacs command [ok]
- emacs command documentation [ok]
- *flycheck* checker?
Challenge: You don't always get a line and coll in the gitlab errors.
Can mark the whole buffer, then.
Or the first line.
